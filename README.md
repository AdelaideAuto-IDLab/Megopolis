# Megopolis
Megopolis Project Code and Documentation.

## Introduction

Megopolis is an open source framework for resampling algorithms on GPUs, which is an essential part to improve performance of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) or Particle Filtering algorithms.  This repository is provided as part of the following papers :

Chesser J., Nguyen H. V., & Damith C. (2020). *Memory Coalesced Metropolis Resampling: The Megopolis Resampler*.  Which is currently submitted to [Digital Signal Processing](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/digital-signal-processing/). 

**We will release the full source-code upon the acceptance of our paper.**
