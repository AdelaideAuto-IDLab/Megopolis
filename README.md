# Megopolis
Megopolis Project Code and Documentation.

## Introduction

Megopolis is an open source framework for resampling algorithms on GPUs, which is an essential part to improve performance of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) or Particle Filtering algorithms.  This repository is provided as part of the following papers :

Chesser J., Nguyen H. V., & Damith C. (2021). *The Megopolis Resampler: Memory Coalesced Resampling on GPUs*, which is accepted to [Digital Signal Processing](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/digital-signal-processing/). See [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13504). 

**We will release the full source-code soon.**
